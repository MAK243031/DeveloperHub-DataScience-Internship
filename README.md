# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions with features like transaction amount, time, and class (fraudulent or legitimate).

## Models

Two models are implemented:

* **Logistic Regression:** A simple and efficient model for binary classification.
* **Random Forest:** An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using bar charts.

## Usage

To use the fraud detection model:

1. Install the required libraries:
